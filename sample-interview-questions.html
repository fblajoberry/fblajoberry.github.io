<h2 style="color:black;">Common Questions and How to Answer them</h2>
						<p style="color:black;">	1. Tell me about yourself. -

This is one of the first questions you are likely to be asked. Be prepared to talk about yourself, and why you're an excellent fit for the job. Try to answer questions about yourself without giving out too much, or too little, personal information. <br>
2. What is your greatest strength? -

This is one of the questions that employers almost always ask. When you are asked about your greatest strengths, it's important to discuss the attributes that will qualify you for the specific job and set you apart from the other candidates. Take the time, before the job interview, to make matches between your qualifications and the requirements as stated in the job announcement. This way, you will have examples ready to share.<br>
3. What is your greatest weakness? -

Another question interviewers will ask is about your weaknesses. Do your best to frame your answers around positive aspects of your skills and abilities as an employee, turning a “weaknesses” into strengths.<br>
Why should we hire you? -
Be prepared to say why you're the applicant who should be hired.  This is not the time to be modest. Make your response a confident, concise, explain what you have to offer the employer, and why you should get the job.<br>
5. What are your salary expectations? -

It seems like a simple question, but your answer can knock you out of the contest for the job if you overprice yourself. If you underprice yourself, you may get shortchanged and a lower offer. Review the best way to answer questions about salary so you get the fair pay that you deserve.<br>
Why are you leaving or have left your job? -

When asked about why you are moving on from your current position, stick with the facts, be direct, and focus your interview answer on the future.<br>
Why do you want this job? -

This question gives you an opportunity to show the interviewer what you know about the job and the company, so take the time before the interview to thoroughly research the company, its products or services, its climate, and its mission. Be specific about what makes you a good fit for this role, and mention aspects of the company and position that appeal to you.<br>
8. How do you handle stress and pressure? -
Avoid claiming that you never, or rarely, experience stress. Not only is this difficult to believe, but it could also lead the interviewer to believe that you’ve only worked in low-pressure environments and therefore aren’t prepared to handle a difficult situation. Instead, answer in a way that acknowledges workplace stress and explains how you’ve overcome it, or even used it to your advantage.<br>
9. Describe a difficult work situation / project and how you overcame it. -

The interviewer wants to know what you do when you face a difficult decision. As with the question about stress, be prepared to share an example of what you did in a tough situation.<br>
10. What are your goals for the future? -

This question is designed to find out if you’re going to stick around or move on as soon as you find a better opportunity. Keep your answer focused on the job and the company you’re interviewing with, and explain to the interviewer that the positions aligns with your long-term goals.<br>
